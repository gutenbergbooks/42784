<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>BLACKGUARD.</h3>

  <p>In some of the earlier numbers of "N. &amp; Q.," there occur
  disquisitions as to the origin of the term <i>blackguard</i>, and the
  time at which it came into use in England in its present sense. But the
  communications of your correspondents have not been satisfactory upon
  either point&mdash;they have not shown the period at which the word came
  to be accepted <i>in its present sense</i>; and their quotations all
  apply to its use in a much more simple meaning, and one totally different
  from that which we now attach to it.</p>

  <p>One class of these quotations (Vol. ii., pp. 171. 285.), such as the
  passages from <span class="sc">Butler</span> and <span
  class="sc">Fuller</span>, refer obviously to a popular superstition,
  during an age when the belief in witchcraft and hobgoblins was universal;
  and when such creatures of fancy were assigned as <i>Black Guards</i> to
  his Satanic majesty. "Who can conceive," says <span
  class="sc">Fuller</span> in the paragraph extracted, "but that such a
  Prince-principal of Darkness must be proportionally attended by a Black
  Guard of monstrous opinions?" (<i>Church History</i>, b. ix. c. xvi.) And
  in the verses of <span class="sc">Butler</span> referred to, Hudibras,
  when deceived by Ralpho counterfeiting a ghost in the dark,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Believed it was some drolling sprite</p>
      <p>That <i>staid upon the guard</i> at night:"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>and thereupon in his trepidation discourses with the Squire as
  follows:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Thought he, How does the <i>Devil</i> know</p>
      <p>What 'twas that I design'd to do?</p>
      <p>His office of intelligence,</p>
      <p>His oracles, are ceas'd long since;</p>
      <p>And he knows nothing of the Saints,</p>
      <p>But what some treach'rous spy acquaints.</p>
      <p>This is some petty-fogging <i>fiend</i>,</p>
      <p>Some under door-keeper's friend's friend,</p>
      <p>That undertakes to understand,</p>
      <p>And juggles at the second hand:</p>
      <p>And now would pass for spirit Po,</p>
      <p>And all men's dark concerns foreknow.</p>
      <p>I think I need not fear him for't;</p>
      <p>These rallying <i>devils</i> do not hurt.</p>
<!-- Page 78 --><span class="pagenum" title="079.png"><a name="page78"></a>{78}</span>
      <p>With that he roused his drooping heart,</p>
      <p>And hastily cry'd out, What art?&mdash;</p>
      <p>A wretch, quoth he, whom want of grace</p>
      <p>Has brought to this unhappy place.</p>
      <p class="i1">I do believe thee, quoth the knight;</p>
      <p>Thus far I'm sure thou'rt in the right,</p>
      <p>And know what 'tis that troubles thee,</p>
      <p>Better than thou hast guess'd of me.</p>
      <p>Thou art some paltry, <i>blackguard sprite</i>,</p>
      <p>Condemn'd to drudg'ry in the night;</p>
      <p>Thou hast no work to do in th' house,</p>
      <p><i>Nor half-penny to drop in shoes</i>;</p>
      <p>Without the raising of which sum</p>
      <p>You dare not be so troublesome;</p>
      <p>To pinch the slatterns black and blue,</p>
      <p>For leaving you their work to do.</p>
      <p>This is your business, good Pug Robin,</p>
      <p>And your diversion, dull dry bobbing."</p>
      <p class="i1"><i>Hudibras</i>, Part III. Canto 1. line 1385, &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>It will be seen that <span class="sc">Butler</span>, like <span
  class="sc">Fuller</span>, uses the term in the simple sense as a
  <i>guard</i> of the Prince of Darkness. But the concluding lines of
  Hudibras's address to Ralpho explain the process by which, at a late
  period, this term of the <i>Black Guard</i> came to be applied to the
  lowest class of domestics in great establishments.</p>

  <p>The Black Guard of Satan was supposed to perform the domestic drudgery
  of the kitchen and servants' hall, in the infernal household. The extract
  from <span class="sc">Hobbes</span> (Vol. ii., p. 134.) refers to
  this:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Since my Lady's decay, I am degraded from a cook; and I fear the
  Devil himself will entertain me but for one of his <i>black guard</i>,
  and he shall be sure to have his roast burnt."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Hence came the popular superstition that these goblin scullions, on
  their visits to the upper world, confined themselves to the servants'
  apartments of the houses which they favoured with their presence, and
  which at night they swept and garnished; pinching those of the maids in
  their sleep who, by their laziness, had imposed such toil on their elfin
  assistants; but <i>slipping money into the shoes</i> of the more tidy and
  industrious servants, whose attention to their own duties before going to
  rest had spared the goblins the task of performing their share of the
  drudgery. Hudibras apostrophises the ghost as&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"... some paltry <i>blackguard</i> sprite</p>
      <p>Condemn'd to drudgery in the night;</p>
      <p>Thou hast no work to do in th' house</p>
      <p>Nor half-penny to drop in shoes;"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>and therefore, as the knight concluded&mdash;"this devil full of
  malice" had found sufficient leisure to taunt and rally him in the dark
  upon his recent disasters.</p>

  <p>This belief in the visits of domestic spirits, who busy themselves at
  night in sweeping and arranging the lower apartments, has prevailed in
  the North of Ireland and in Scotland from time immemorial: and it is
  explained in <span class="sc">Sir Walter Scott's</span> notes to the
  <i>Lay of the Last Minstrel</i>, as his justification for introducing the
  goblin page Gilpin Horner amongst the domestics of Branksome Hall.
  Perhaps, from the association of these elves with the lower household
  duties, but more probably from a more obvious cause, came at a later
  period the practice described by <span class="sc">Gifford</span> in his
  note on <span class="sc">Ben Jonson</span>, as quoted by your
  correspondent (Vol. ii., p. 170.), by which&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"in all great houses, but particularly in the Royal Residences, there
  were a number of mean dirty dependents, whose office it was to attend the
  wool-yard, sculleries, &amp;c. Of these, the most forlorn wretches seem
  to have been selected to carry coals to the kitchens, halls, &amp;c. To
  this smutty regiment, who attended the progresses, and rode in the carts
  with the pots and kettles, the people, in derision, gave the name of the
  <i>black guards</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This is no doubt correct; and hence the expression of <span
  class="sc">Beaumont</span> and <span class="sc">Fletcher</span>, quoted
  from the <i>Elder Brother</i>, that&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"... from the <i>black guard</i></p>
      <p>To the grim Sir in office, there are few</p>
      <p>Hold other tenets:"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>meaning from the lowest domestic to the highest functionary of a
  household. This too explains the force of the allusion, in Jardine's
  <i>Criminal Trials</i>, to the apartments of Euston House being "far
  unmeet for her Highness, but fitter for the Black Guard"&mdash;that is,
  for the scullions and lowest servants of an establishment. <span
  class="sc">Swift</span> employs the word in this sense when he says, in
  the extract quoted by Dr. Johnson in his <i>Dictionary</i> in
  illustration of the meaning of <i>blackguard</i>,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Let a black-guard boy be always about the house to send on your
  errands, and go to market for you on rainy days."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It will thus be seen, that of the six authors quoted in "N. &amp; Q."
  no one makes use of the term <i>black guard</i> in an opprobrious sense
  such as attaches to the more modern word "blackguard;" and that they all
  wrote within the first fifty years of the seventeenth century. It must
  therefore be subsequent not only to that date, but to the reign of Queen
  Anne, that we are to look for its general acceptance in its present
  contumelious sense. And I believe that its introduction may be traced to
  a recent period, and to a much more simple derivation than that
  investigated by your correspondents.</p>

  <p>I apprehend that the present term, "a blackguard," is of French
  origin; and that its importation into our language was subsequent to the
  Restoration of Charles II., <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 1660. There is a
  corresponding term in French, <i>blague</i>, which, like our English
  adaptation, is not admissible in good society. It is defined by
  Bescherelles, in his great <i>Dictionnaire National</i>, to mean
  "fanfaronnade, hâblerie, mensonge; bourde, gasconade:" and to <!-- Page
  79 --><span class="pagenum" title="080.png"><a
  name="page79"></a>{79}</span>be "un mot populaire et bas, dont les
  personnes bien élevées évitent de se servir." From <i>blague</i> comes
  the verb <i>blaguer</i>, which the same authority says means "dire des
  blagues; mentir pour le plaisir de mentir." And from <i>blaguer</i> comes
  the substantive <i>blagueur</i>, which is, I apprehend, the original of
  our English word <i>blackguard</i>. It is described by Bescherelles as a
  "diseur de sornettes et de faussetées; hâbleur, fanfaron. Un
  <i>blagueur</i> est un menteur, mais un menteur qui a moins pour but de
  tromper que de se faire valoir."</p>

  <p>The English term has, it will be observed, a somewhat wider and more
  offensive import than the French: and the latter being rarely to be found
  amongst educated persons, or in dictionaries, it may have escaped the
  etymologists who were in search of a congener for its English derivative.
  Its pedigree is, however, to be sought in philological rather than
  archæological records. Within the last two centuries, a number of words
  of honest origin have passed into an opprobrious sense; for example, the
  oppressed tenants of Ireland are spoken of by <span
  class="sc">Spenser</span> and <span class="sc">Sir John Davies</span> as
  "<i>villains</i>." In our version of the Scriptures, "<i>cunning</i>"
  implies merely skill in music and in art. <span
  class="sc">Shakspeare</span> employs the word "<i>vagabond</i>" as often
  to express pity as reproach; and I think it will be found, that as a
  <i>knave</i>, prior to the reign of Elizabeth, meant merely a serving
  man, so a <i>blackguard</i> was the name for a pot-boy or scullion in the
  reign of Queen Anne. The transition into its more modern meaning took
  place at a later period, on the importation of a foreign word, to which,
  being already interchangeable in sound, it speedily became assimilated in
  sense.</p>

<h3>PREDICTIONS OF THE FIRE AND PLAGUE OF LONDON, NO. I.</h3>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It was a trim worke indeede, and a gay world no doubt for some idle
  cloister-man, mad merry friers, and lusty abbey-lubbers; when themselves
  were well whittled, and their paunches pretily stuffed, to fall a
  prophesieing of the woefull dearths, famines, plagues, wars, &amp;c. of
  the dangerous days imminent."&mdash;Harvey's <i>Discoursive Probleme</i>,
  Lond. 1588.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Among the sly hits at our nation, which abound in the lively pages of
  the Sieur d'Argenton, is one to the effect that an Englishman always has
  an old prophecy in his possession. The worthy Sieur is describing the
  meeting of Louis X. and our Henry II. near Picquini, where the Chancellor
  of England commenced his harangue by alluding to an ancient prophecy
  which predicted that the Plain of Picquini should be the scene of a
  memorable and lasting peace between the two nations. "The Bishop," says
  Commines, "commença par une prophétie, dont," adds he, <i>en
  parenthèse</i>, "les Anglois ne sont jamais despourveus."<a
  name="footnotetag1" href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Even at this
  early period, we had thus acquired a reputation for prophecies, and it
  must be confessed that our chronicles abound in passages which illustrate
  the justice of the Sieur's sarcasm. From the days of York and Lancaster,
  when, according to Lord Northampton "bookes of beasts and babyes were
  exceeding ryfe, and current in every quarter and corner of the realme,"<a
  name="footnotetag2" href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> up to the time
  of Napoleon's projected invasion, when the presses of the Seven Dials
  were unusually prolific in visions and predictions, pandering to the
  popular fears of the country&mdash;our national character for
  vaticination has been amply sustained by a goodly array of prophets, real
  or pretended, whose lucubrations have not even yet entirely lost their
  influence upon the popular mind. To this day, the ravings of Nixon are
  "household words" in Cheshire; and I am told that a bundle of "Dame
  Shipton's Sayings" still forms a very saleable addition to the pack of a
  Yorkshire pedlar. Recent discoveries in biological science have given to
  the subject of popular prophecies a philosophical importance beyond the
  mere curiosity or strangeness of the details. Whether or not the human
  mind, under certain conditions, becomes endowed with the prescient
  faculty, is a question I do not wish to discuss in your pages: I merely
  wish to direct attention to a neglected and not uninteresting chapter in
  the curiosities of literature.</p>

  <p>In delving among what may be termed the popular religious literature
  of the latter years of the Commonwealth, and early part of the reign of
  Charles, we become aware of the existence of a kind of nightmare which
  the public of that age were evidently labouring under&mdash;a strong and
  vivid impression that some terrible calamity was impending over the
  metropolis. Puritanic tolerance was sorely tried by the licence of the
  new Court; and the pulpits were soon filled with enthusiasts of all
  sects, who railed in no measured terms against the monster city&mdash;the
  city Babylon&mdash;the bloody city! as they loved to term her:
  proclaiming with all the fervour of fanaticism that the measure of her
  iniquities was well nigh full, and the day of her extinction at hand. The
  press echoed the cry; and for some years before and after the
  Restoration, it teemed with "warnings" and "visions," in which the
  approaching destruction is often plainly predicted. One of the earliest
  of these prefigurations occurs in that Leviathan of Sermons, <i>God's
  Plea for Nineveh, or London's Precedent for Mercy</i>, by Thomas Reeve:
  London, 1657. Speaking of London, he says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>It was Troy-novant, it is Troy le grand, and it will be Troy
  l'extinct."&mdash;P. 217.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><!-- Page 80 --><span class="pagenum" title="081.png"><a name="page80"></a>{80}</span></p>

  <p>And again:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Methinks I see you bringing pick-axes to dig downe your owne walls,
  and kindling sparks that will act all in a flame from one end of the city
  to the other."&mdash;P. 214.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And afterwards, in a strain of rough eloquence:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"This goodly city of yours all in shreds, ye may seek for a threshold
  of your antient dwellings, for a pillar of your pleasant habitations, and
  not find them; all your spacious mansions and sumptuous monuments are
  then gone.... Wo unto us, our sins have pulled down our houses, shaken
  down our city; we are the most harbourlesse featlesse people in the
  world.... Foxes have holes, and the fowls of the air nests, but we have
  neither; our sins have deprived us both of couch and covert. What
  inventions shall ye then be put to, to secure yourselves, when your sins
  shall have shut up all the conduits of the city, and suffer only the
  Liver conduit to run<a name="footnotetag3"
  href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>; when they allow you no showers of
  rain, but showers of blood; when ye shall see no men of your
  incorporation, but the mangl'd citizen; nor hear no noise in your streets
  but the crys, the shrieks, the yells and pangs of gasping, dying men;
  when, amongst the throngs of associates, not a man will own you or come
  near you," &amp;c.&mdash;Pp. 221. <i>et seq.</i></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>After alluding to the epidemics of former ages, he thus alludes to the
  coming plague:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It will chase men out of their houses, as if there was some fierce
  enemy pursuing them, and shut up shop doors, as if execution after
  judgment was served upon the merchants; there will then be no other music
  to be heard but doleful knells, nor no other wares to be born up and down
  but dead corpses; it will change mansion houses into pest-houses, and
  gather congregations rather into churchyards than churches.... The
  markets will be so empty, that scarce necessaries will be brought in, a
  new kind of brewers will set up, even apothecaries to prepare diet
  drinks."&mdash;P. 255.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The early Quakers, like most other religious enthusiasts, claimed the
  gift of prophecy: and we are indebted to members of the sect for many
  contributions to this branch of literature. Humphrey Smith was one of the
  most celebrated of the vaticinating Quakers. Little is known of his life
  and career. He appears to have joined the Quakers about 1654; and after
  enduring a long series of persecutions and imprisonments for the sake of
  his adopted creed, finally ended his days in Winchester gaol in 1662. The
  following passage, from a <i>Vision which he saw concerning London</i>
  (London, 1660). is startling<a name="footnotetag4"
  href="#footnote4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"And as for the city, herself and her suburbs, and all that belonged
  to her, a fire was kindled therin; but she knew not how, even in all her
  goodly places, and the kindling of it was in the foundation of all her
  buildings, and there was none could quench it.... And the burning thereof
  was exceeding great, and it burned inward in a hidden manner which cannot
  be described.... All the tall buildings fell, and it consumed all the
  lofty things therein, and the fire searched out all the hidden places,
  and burned most in the secret places. And as I passed through her streets
  I beheld her state to be very miserable, and very few were those who were
  left in her, who were but here and there one: and they feared not the
  fire, neither did the burning hurt them, but they walked as dejected
  mournful people.... And the fire continued, for, though all the lofty
  part was brought down, yet there was much old stuffe, and parts of
  broken-down desolate walls, which the fire continued burning against....
  And the vision thereof remained in me as a thing that was showed me of
  the Lord."</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>

  <p><i>Irish Superstitious Customs.</i>&mdash;The following strange
  practices of the Irish are described in a MS. of the sixteenth century,
  and seem to have a Pagan origin:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Upon Maie Eve they will drive their cattell upon their neighbour's
  corne, to eate the same up; they were wont to begin from the rast, and
  this principally upon the English churl. Onlesse they do so upon Maie
  daie, the witch hath power upon their cattell all the yere
  following."</p>

  <p>The next paragraph observes that "they spitt in the face; Sir R. Shee
  spat in Ladie &mdash;&mdash; face."</p>

  <p>Spenser alludes to spitting on a person for luck, and I have
  experienced the ceremony myself.</p>

  <p class="author">H.</p>

  <p><i>Charm for Warts.</i>&mdash;I remember in Leicestershire seeing the
  following charm employed for removal of a number of warts on my brother,
  then a child about five years old. In the month of April or May he was
  taken to an ash-tree by a lady, who carried also a paper of fresh pins;
  one of these was first struck through the bark, and then pressed through
  the wart until it produced pain: it was then taken out and stuck into the
  tree. Each wart was thus treated, a separate pin being used for each. The
  warts certainly disappeared in about six weeks. I saw the same tree a
  year or two again, when it was very thickly studded over with old pins,
  each the index of a cured wart.</p>

<h3>MALTA THE BURIAL-PLACE OF HANNIBAL.</h3>

  <p>Malta affords a fine field for antiquarian research; and in no part
  more so than in the neighbourhood of Citta Vecchia, where for some
  distance the ground is dotted with tombs which have already been
  opened.</p>

  <p>Here, in ancient times, was the site of a burial-place, but for what
  people, or at what age, is now unknown; and here it is that archæologists
  should commence their labours, that in the result they may not be
  disappointed. In some of the tombs which have been recently entered in
  this vicinity, fragments of linen cloth have been seen, in which bodies
  were enveloped at the time of their burial; in others glass, and earthen
  candlesticks, and jars, hollow throughout and of a curious shape; while
  in a few were earrings and finger-rings made of the purest gold, but they
  are rarely found. <!-- Page 82 --><span class="pagenum" title="083.png"
  ><a name="page82"></a>{82}</span></p>

  <p>There cannot be a doubt that many valuable antiquities will yet be
  discovered, and in support of this presumption I would only refer to
  those now known to exist; the Giant's Tower at Gozo, the huge tombs in
  the Bengemma Hills, and those extensive and remarkable ruins at Krendi,
  which were excavated by order of the late Sir Henry Bouverie, and remain
  as a lasting and honourable memento of his rule, being among the
  number.</p>

  <p>An antiquary, being at Malta, cannot pass a portion of an idle day
  more agreeably than in visiting some singular sepulchral chambers not far
  from Notabile, which are built in a rocky eminence, and with entrances
  several feet from the ground. These are very possibly the tombs of the
  earliest Christians, who tried in their erection "to imitate that of our
  Saviour, by building them in the form of caves, and closing their portals
  with marble or stone." When looking at these tombs from a terrace near
  the Cathedral, we were strongly reminded of those which were seen by our
  lately deceased friend Mr. John L. Stephens, and so well described by him
  in his <i>Incidents of Travel</i> in eastern lands. Had we time or space,
  we should more particularly refer to several other interesting remains
  now scattered over the island, and, among them, to that curious sepulchre
  not a long time ago discovered in a garden at Rabato. We might write of
  the inscription on its walls, "In pace posita sunt," and of the figures
  of a dove and hare which were near it, to show that the ashes of those
  whom they buried there were left in peace. We might also make mention,
  more at length, of a tomb which was found at the point Beni Isa in 1761,
  having on its face a Ph&oelig;nician inscription, which Sir William
  Drummond thus translates:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The interior room of the tomb of Ænnibal, illustrious in the
  consummation of calamity. He was beloved. The people, when they are drawn
  up in order of battle, weep for Ænnibal the son of Bar Malek."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Sir Grenville Temple remarks, that the great Carthaginian general is
  supposed, by the Maltese, to have been a native of their island, and one
  of the Barchina family, once known to have been established in Malta;
  while some writers have stated that his remains were brought from
  Bithynia to this island, to be placed in the tomb of his ancestors; and
  this supposition, from what we have read, may be easily credited.</p>

  <p>Might I ask if there is any writer, ancient or modern, who has
  recorded that Malta was not the burial-place of Hannibal?</p>

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>Waterloo.</i>&mdash;I do not know whether, in any of the numerous
  lives of the late Duke of Wellington, the following fact has been
  noticed. In Strada's History of the Belgian war (a work which deserves to
  be better known and appreciated than it is at present), there occurs a
  passage which shows that, about three hundred years since, Waterloo was
  the scene of a severe engagement; so that the late sanguinary struggle
  was not the first this battle-ground has to boast of. The passage occurs
  in <i>Famianæ Stradæ de Bello Belgico, Decas prima</i>, lib. vi. p. 256.,
  edit. Romæ, 1653; where, after describing a scheme on the part of the
  insurgents for surprising Lille, and its discovery by the Royalists, he
  goes on:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Et Rassinghemius de Armerteriensi milite inaudierat: nihilqve moratvs
  selectis centvmqvinqvaginta peditibvs et equitibus sclopetariis fermè
  qvinqveginta prope <i>Waterlocvm</i> pagvm pvgnam committit."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>What makes this more curious is, that, like the later battle, neither
  of the contending parties on this occasion were natives of the country in
  which the battle was fought, they being the French Calvinists on one side
  and the Spaniards on the other.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Philobiblion.</span></p>

  <p>"<i>Tuch.</i>"&mdash;In "The Synagogue," attached to Herbert's
  <i>Poems</i>, but written by Chr. Harvie, M.A., is a piece entitled "The
  Communion Table," one verse of which is as follows:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"And for the matter whereof it is made,</p>
      <p class="i2">The matter is not much,</p>
      <p class="i2">Although it be of <i>tuch</i>,</p>
      <p>Or wood, or mettal, what will last, or fade;</p>
      <p class="i5">So vanitie</p>
      <p>And superstition avoided be."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>S. T. Coleridge, in a note on this passage, printed in Mr. Pickering's
  edition of Herbert, 1850 (fcap. 8vo.), says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Tuch</i> rhyming to <i>much</i>, from the German <i>tuch</i>,
  cloth: I never met with it before as an English word. So I find
  <i>platt</i>, for foliage, in Stanley's <i>Hist. of Philosophy</i>, p.
  22."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Whether Coleridge rightly appreciated Stanley's use of the word
  <i>platt</i>, I shall not determine; but with regard to <i>touch</i>, it
  is evident that he went (it was the tendency of his mind) to Germany for
  error, when truth might have been discovered nearer home. The context
  shows that <i>cloth</i> could not have been intended, for who ever heard
  of a table or altar made of cloth? The truth is that the poet meant
  <i>touchstone</i>, which the author of the <i>Glossary of
  Architecture</i> (3rd edit., text and appendix) rightly explains to be
  "the dark-coloured stone or marble, anciently used for tombstones. A
  musical sound" (it is added) "may be produced by touching it sharply with
  a stick." And this is in fact the reason for its name. The author of the
  <i>Glossary of Architecture</i> cites <i>Ben Jonson</i> by Gifford, viii.
  251., and <i>Archæol.</i>, xvi. 84.</p>

  <p><i>The Dodo.</i>&mdash;Among the seals, or rather sulphur casts, in
  the British Museum, is one of Nicholas Saumares, anno 1400. It represents
  an esquire's helmet, from which depends obliquely a shield with the
  arms&mdash;supporters&mdash;dexter a unicorn, sinister a greyhound;
  crest, a bird, which from its unwieldy body and disproportionate wings I
  take to be a Dodo: and the more probability attaches itself to this
  conjecture, since <i>Dodo</i> seems to have been the surname of the
  Counts de Somery, or Somerie (query Saumarez), as mentioned in p. 2. of
  Add. MSS. 17,455. in the British Museum, and alluded to in a former No.
  of "N. &amp; Q." This seal, like many others, is not in such a state of
  preservation as to warrant the assertion that we have found a veritable
  Dodo. I only offer it as a hint to <span class="sc">Mr. Strickland</span>
  and others, that have written so learnedly on this head. Burke gives a
  falcon for the crest of Saumarez; but the clumsy form and figure of this
  bird does not in any way assimilate with any of the falcon tribe.</p>

  <p>Dodo seems also to have been used as a Christian name, as in the same
  volume of MSS. quoted above we find Dodo de Cisuris, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><i>Francis I.</i>&mdash;Mention has been made in "N. &amp; Q." of
  Francis I.'s celebrated "Tout est perdu hormis l'honneur!" but the beauty
  of that phrase is lost in its real position,&mdash;a long letter to
  Louisa of Savoy, his mother. The letter is given at full length in
  Sismondi's <i>Histoire des Français</i>.</p>

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>DR. ANTHONY MARSHALL.</h3>

  <p>In 1662 Anthony Marshall, D.D., was Rector of Bottesford, in
  Leicestershire. Nichols adds a <i>query</i> after his name; whether he
  were of the Bishop of Exeter's family? and a <i>note</i>, that Anthony
  Marshall was created D.D. at Cambridge in 1661 by royal mandate (<i>Hist.
  Leic.</i>, vol ii. p. 77.); and again, Dr. Anthony Marshall preached a
  Visitation Sermon at Melton in 1667, Aug. 11. I do not find that any
  Bishop of Exeter bore the name of Marshall except Henry Marshall in 1191,
  of course too far back to suppose that the Query could refer to him; but
  I have not introduced this Note to quarrel with Mr. Nichols, but to ask
  if this is all that is known of a man who must, in his day, have attained
  to considerable eminence. I more than suspect that this Dr. Marshall was
  a native of Staveley in Derbyshire. Sir Peter Frescheville, in his will,
  dated in 1632, gives to St. John's College, Cambridge, 50<i>l.</i> "for
  the buying of bookes to furnish some one of the desks in the new library
  lately built and erected in the said college; and expresses his desire
  that the said money shall be layed forth, and the bookes bought,
  provided, and placed in the said library by the paines, care, and
  discression of his two loveing friends, Mr. Robert Hitch, late Fellow of
  Trinity College in Cambridge; and Mr. Robert Marshall, Fellow of St.
  John's College<a name="footnotetag5"
  href="#footnote5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>; or the survivor of
  them,"&mdash;which last Robert, I suspect, should be Anthony.</p>

  <p>In 1677 Anthony Marshall, D.D., Rector of Bottesford, was a subscriber
  of 10<i>l.</i> towards a fund then raised for yearly distribution; and
  there is only one name precedes his, or subscribes a larger amount, and
  that is Dr. Hitch before named.</p>

  <p>Mr. Bagshaw, in his <i>Spiritualibus Pecci</i>, 1701, p. 61.,
  referring to Thomas Stanley, one of the ejected ministers, says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Mr. Stanley was born at Dackmonton, three miles from Chesterfield,
  where he had part of his education, as he had another part of it at
  Staley, not far from it. His noted schoolmaster was one Mr. Marshall,
  whose brother made a speech to King James I."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Is there any means of corroborating this incident? In 1682 I observe
  the name of Dr. Marshall amongst the King's Chaplains in Ordinary, and a
  Dr. Marshall (perhaps the same individual) Dean of Gloucester; but
  whether identified in the Doctor about whom I inquire, remains a
  Query.</p>

<h3>LINDIS, MEANING OF.</h3>

  <p>We are told by Bede that <i>Lindisfarne</i>, now Holy Island, derives
  the first part of its name from the small brook Lindis, which at high
  water is quite invisible, being covered by the tide, but at low water is
  seen running briskly into the sea. Now I should be glad to know the
  precise meaning of <i>Lindis</i>. We are informed by etymologists, that
  <i>Lyn</i> or <i>Lin</i>, in names of places, signifies water in any
  shape, as lake, marsh, or stream: but what does the adjunct <i>dis</i>
  mean? Some writers assert that <i>Lindis</i> signifies the linden-tree;
  thus making the sound an echo to the meaning: and hence they assume that
  Lindesey in Lincolnshire must signify an Isle of Linden-trees. But it is
  very doubtful that such a tree ever existed in Lincolnshire anterior to
  the Conquest. The <i>linden</i> is rather a rare tree in England; and the
  two principal species, the <i>Tilia Europea</i> and the <i>Tilia
  grandifolia</i>, are said by botanists not to be indigenous to this
  country, but to have been introduced into our island at an early period
  to adorn the parks of the nobles, and certainly not till after the
  Conquest.</p>

  <p>Dr. Henry, in his <i>History of Britain</i>, vol. iv., gives the
  meaning of "Marsh Isle" to Lindsey, and of "Lake Colony" to Lincolnia.
  This I consider the most probable signification to a district <!-- Page
  84 --><span class="pagenum" title="085.png"><a
  name="page84"></a>{84}</span>that abounded in marshes at that early
  period, when the rude Briton or the Saxon applied names to places the
  most consonant to the aspects they afforded them: nor is it likely they
  would give the name of Lindentree to a small brook, where such a tree
  never could have grown.</p>

  <p>As to the antiquity of the name of Lindes or Lindesey, I should say
  Lindentree must be of comparatively modern nomenclature. I should,
  however, be glad to have the opinion of some of your better-informed
  etymologists on the meaning of the word, as it may decide a point of some
  importance in genealogy.</p>

  <p>We have had additions to our solar system by the discovery of four
  planets within the last few years. Supposing that these planets obey the
  same laws as the larger ones, they must be at all times apparently moving
  within the zodiac; and considering the improvements in telescopes within
  the last seventy years, and the great number of scientific observers at
  all times engaged in the pursuit of astronomy both in Europe and North
  America, I am at a loss to understand why these planets were not
  discovered before.</p>

  <p>I suppose we may not consider them as new creations attached to our
  solar system, because the law of perturbations on which Mr. Herschel <!--

  a-year; and when the power shall be totally on their side, they shall be
  compelled to live on that low allowance, notwithstanding their estates

  <p>[This phrase, according to Grose, "originated in the days of good
  Queen Bess. When great chimnies were in fashion, there was at each corner
  of the hearth, or grate, a small elevated projection, called <i>hob</i>,
  and behind it a seat. In winter-time the beer was placed on the hob to
  warm; and the cold beer was set on a small table, said to have been
  called the <i>nob</i>: so that the <!-- Page 87 --><span class="pagenum" title="088.png"

  seems only to have meant, Will you have warm or cold beer? <i>i.e.</i>
  beer from the hob, or beer from the nob." But Nares, in his
  <i>Glossary</i>, s.v. <i>Habbe</i> or <i>Nabbe</i>, with much greater
  reason, shows that <i>hob</i> or <i>nob</i>, now only used convivially,
  to ask a person whether he will have a glass of wine or not, is most
  evidently a corruption of the old <i>hab-nab</i>, from the Saxon
  <i>habban</i>, to have, and <i>nabban</i>, not to have; in proof of
  which, as Nares remarks, Shakspeare has used it to mark an alternative of
  another kind:</p>

  satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and sepulchre: <i>hob,

  subject, and I have searched my Genealogical MSS. Collections for such;
  the result has extended farther than I could have wished, but, while I am
  able to furnish <i>dates</i> and <i>authorities</i> for hitherto naked
  statements, I have inserted two or three links of descent not before laid
  down.</p>

  <p>A member of the Somersetshire Wellesleighs is said to have accompanied
  Henry II. to Ireland.</p>

  <p>Walleran or Walter de Wellesley, living in Ireland in 1230 (Lynch,
  <i>Feud. Dig.</i>), witnessed a grant of certain townlands to the Priory
  of Christ Church about 1250 (<i>Registry of Christ Church</i>); while it
  is more effectively stated that he then "endowed the Priory of All Saints
  with 60 a. of land, within the manor of Cruagh, <i>which then belonged,
  with other estates, to his family</i>, and that he gave to the said
  priory <i>free common of pasture, of wood and of turbary, over his whole
  mountain there</i>."</p>

  <p>His namesake and son (according to Lynch, <i>Feud. Dig.</i>), "Walran
  de Wylesley," was in 1302 required, as one of the "Fideles" of Ireland,
  by three several letters, to do service in the meditated war in Scotland
  (<i>Parl. Writs</i>, vol. i. p. 363.), and in the following year he was
  slain (<i>MS. Book of Obits, T.C.D.</i>). The peerage books merge these
  two Wallerans in one.</p>

  <p>William de Wellesley, who appears to have been son to Walleran, was in
  1309 appointed Constable of the Castle of Kildare (<i>Rot. Pat. Canc.
  Hib.</i>), which he maintained when besieged by the Bruces in their
  memorable invasion of Ireland, and their foray over that county. For
  these and other services to the state he received many lucrative and
  honourable grants from the crown, and was summoned to parliament in 1339.
  In 1347 he was slain at the siege of Calais. (<i>Obits, T.C.D.</i>)</p>

  <p>Sir John de Wellesly, Knight, son of William, having performed great
  actions against the O'Tooles and O'Byrnes of Wicklow, had grants of
  sundry wardships and other rewards from the year 1335. In 1343 he became
  one of the sureties for the appearance of the suspected Earl of Desmond,
  on whose flight Sir John's estates were seised to the crown and withheld
  for some years. (Lynch's <i>Feud. Dig.</i>)</p>

  <p>His successor was another John de Wellesley, omitted in the peerage
  books, but whose existence is shown by <i>Close Roll 29 &amp; 30 Edw.
  III., C. H.</i> He died about the year 1355.</p>

  <p>William Wellesley, son of John, was summoned to great councils and
  parliaments of Ireland from 1372; he was also entrusted by the king with
  various important commissions and custodies of castles, lands, and wards
  (<i>Patent Rolls C. H.</i>). In 1386 he was Sheriff of Kildare, and Henry
  IV. renewed his commission in 1403.</p>

  <p>Richard, son and heir of William de Wellesley, as proved by <i>Rot.
  Pat. 1 Henry IV., Canc. Hib.</i>, married Johanna, daughter and heiress
  of Sir Nicholas de Castlemartin, by whom the estates of Dangan,
  Mornington, &amp;c. passed to the Wellesley family; he and his said wife
  had confirmation of their estates in 1422. (<i>Rot. Pat. 1 Henry VI., C.
  H.</i>) He had a previous grant from the treasury by order of the Privy
  Council, in consideration of his long services as sheriff of the county
  of Kildare, and yet more actively "in the wars of Munster, Meath, and
  Leinster, with men and horses, arms and money." (<i>Rot. Claus. 17 Ric.
  II., C. H.</i>) In 1431 he was specially commissioned to advise the crown
  on the state of Ireland, and was subsequently selected to take charge of
  the Castle of Athy, as "the fittest person to maintain that fortress and
  key of the country against the malice of the Irish enemy." (<i>Rot. Pat.
  et Claus. 9 Henry VI., C. H.</i>) In resisting that "malice" he fell soon
  after.</p>

  <p>The issue of Sir Richard de Wellesley by Johanna were William
  Wellesley, who married Katherine &mdash;&mdash;, and dying in 1441 was
  succeeded by his next brother, Christopher Wellesley, whose recorded
  fealty in the same year proves all the latter links; his succession to
  William as brother and heir, and the titles of Johanna as widow of his
  father Richard, and of Katherine as widow of William, to dower off said
  estates. (<i>Rot. Claus. 19 Henry VI.</i>, <i>C. H.</i>) At and previous
  to this time, another line of this family, connected as cousins with the
  house of Dangan, flourished in the co. Kildare, where they were
  recognised as Palatine Barons of Norragh to the close of the seventeenth
  century. William Wellesley of Dangan was the son and heir of Christopher.
  An (unprinted) act of Edward IV. was passed in 1472 in favour of this
  William; and his two marriages are stated by Lynch (<i>Feud. Dig.</i>):
  the first was to <!-- Page 88 --><span class="pagenum" title="089.png"><a
  name="page88"></a>{88}</span>Ismay Plunkett; the second, to Maud O'Toole,
  was contracted under peculiar circumstances. The law of Ireland at the
  time prohibited the intermarriages of the English with the natives
  without royal licence therefor being previously obtained, and not even
  did the licence so obtained wash out the <i>original sin</i> of Irish
  birth; for, as in this instance, Maud, having survived her first husband,
  on marrying her second, Patrick Hussey, had a fresh licence to legalise
  that marriage. It is of record (<i>Rot. Pat. 21 Henry VII., C. H.</i>),
  and proves the second marriage of Sir William clearly: yet it is not
  noticed in any of the peerage books, which derive his issue from the
  first wife, and not from the second, as Lynch gives it, that issue being
  Gerald the eldest son, Walter the second, and Alison a daughter.</p>

  <p>Gerald had a special livery of his estate in 1539; Walter the second
  son became Bishop of Kildare in 1531, and died its diocesan in 1539 (see
  Ware's <i>Bishops</i>); and the daughter Alison intermarried with John
  Cusack of Cushington, co. Meath. (Burke's <i>Landed Gentry</i>, Supp. p.
  88.)</p>

  <p>Gerald, according to all the peerage books, married Margaret, eldest
  daughter of Sir Thomas Fitzgerald, who was Lord Chancellor of Ireland in
  1483, and had issue William, his eldest son, Lord of Dangan, who married
  Elizabeth Cusack, of Portrane, co. Dublin, and died previous to 1551 (as
  I believe is proveable by <i>inquisitions</i> of that year in the office
  of the Chief Remembrancer, Dublin), leaving Gerald, his eldest son and
  heir. An inquiry taken in 1579 as to the extent of the manor of Dangan,
  finds him then seised thereof (<i>Inquis. in C. H. 23 Eliz.</i>).
  Previous to this he appears a party in conveyances of record, as in 1564,
  &amp;c. He had a son Edward (not mentioned in the peerage books), who
  joined in a family conveyance of 1599, and soon after died, leaving a
  son, Valerian Wellesley. Gerald himself died in 1603, leaving said
  Valerian, his grandson and heir, then aged ten (<i>Inquis. 5 Jac. I. in
  Rolls Office</i>), and <i>married</i>, adds the Inquisition; and Lynch,
  in his <i>Feudal Dignities</i>, gives interesting particulars of the
  betrothal of this boy, and his public repudiation of the intended match
  on his coming to age. This Valerian is traced through Irish records to
  the time of the Restoration; he married first, Maria Cusack (by whom he
  had William Wellesley, his eldest son), and, second, Anne Forth,
  otherwise Cusack, widow of Sir Ambrose Forth, as shown by an Inquisition
  of 1637, in the Rolls Office, Dublin.</p>

  <p>William Wellesley, son and heir of Valerian, married Margaret Kempe
  (<i>Peerage Books</i>), and by her had Gerald Wellesley, who on the
  Restoration petitioned to be restored to his estates, and a Decree of
  Innocence issued, which states the rights of himself, his father, and his
  grandfather in "Dingen." This Gerald married Elizabeth, eldest daughter
  of Sir Dudley Colley, and their first daughter was baptized in 1663 by
  the name of Margaret, some evidence, in the courtesy of christenings, of
  Gerald's mother being Margaret. (<i>Registry of St. Werburgh's.</i>)
  Gerald was a suitor in the Court of Claims in 1703: he left two sons;
  William the eldest died <i>s. p.</i>, and was succeeded by Garrett, his
  next brother, who died also without issue in 1728, having bequeathed all
  the family estates to Richard Colley, second son of the aforesaid Sir
  Dudley Colley, and testator's uncle, enjoining upon said Richard and his
  heirs male to bear thenceforth, as they succeeded to the estates, the
  name and arms of Wellesley.</p>

  <p>This Richard Colley Wellesley married Elizabeth, daughter of John
  Sale, LL.D. and M.P., by whom he had issue Garrett Wellesley, born, as
  the <i>Dublin and London Magazine</i> for 1735 announces, "19th July,"
  when "the Lady of Richard Colley Westley was delivered of a son and heir,
  <i>to the great joy of that family</i>." This son was father of the
  Marquis Wellesley and of the <span class="sc">Duke of
  Wellington</span>!</p>

<h3>CONSECRATED RINGS FOR EPILEPSY.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vi., p. 603.)</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Sir W. C. T.</span> has opened a very interesting
  field for inquiry regarding these blest rings.</p>

  <p>St. Edward, in his last illness (obiit January 5, 1066), gave a ring
  which he wore to the Abbot of Westminster. The origin of this ring is
  surrounded by much mystery. A pilgrim is said to have brought it to the
  king, and to have informed him that St. John the Evangelist had made
  known to the donor that the king's decease was at hand. "St. Edward's
  ring" was kept for some time at Westminster Abbey, as a relic of the
  saint, and was applied for the cure of the falling sickness or epilepsy,
  and for cramp. From this arose the custom of our English kings, who were
  believed to have inherited St. Edward's powers of cure, solemnly blessing
  every year rings for distribution.</p>

  <p>It is said, we know not on what authority, that the ring did not
  always remain at Westminster, but that in the chapel of Havering (so
  called from <i>having the ring</i>), in the parish of Hornchurch, near
  Rumford in Essex (once a hunting-seat of the kings), was kept, till the
  dissolution of religious houses, the identical ring given by the pilgrim
  to St. Edward. Weaver says he saw it represented in a window of Rumford
  Church.</p>

  <p>These rings seem to have been blessed for two different species of
  cure: first, against the falling sickness (comitialis morbus); and,
  secondly, against the cramp (contracta membra). For the cure of the
  king's evil the sovereign did not bless rings, but continued to
  <i>touch</i> the patient. <!-- Page 89 --><span class="pagenum" title="090.png"
  ><a name="page89"></a>{89}</span></p>

  <p>Good Friday was the day appointed for the blessing of the rings. They
  were often called "medijcinable rings," and were made both of gold and
  silver; and as we learn from the household books of Henry IV. and Edward
  IV., the metal they were composed of was what formed the king's offering
  to the cross on Good Friday. The following entry occurs in the accounts
  of the 7th and 8th years of Henry IV. (1406): "In oblacionibus Domini
  Regis factis adorando Crucem in capella infra manerium suum de Eltham,
  die Parascevis, in precio trium nobilium auri et v solidorum sterlyng,
  xxv <i>s.</i></p>

  <p>"In denariis solutis pro eisdem oblacionibus reassumptis, pro annulis
  medicinalibus inde faciendis, xxv <i>s.</i>"</p>

  <p>The prayers used at the ceremony of blessing the rings on Good Friday
  are published in Waldron's <i>Literary Museum</i>. Cardinal Wiseman has
  in his possession a MS. containing both the ceremony for the blessing the
  cramp rings, and the ceremony for the touching for the king's evil. At
  the commencement of the MS. are emblazoned the arms of Philip and Mary:
  the first ceremony is headed, "Certain prayers to be used by the quenes
  heignes in the consecration of the crampe rynges." Accompanying it is an
  illumination representing the queen kneeling, with a dish, containing the
  rings to be blessed, on each side of her. The second ceremony is
  entitled, "The ceremonye for y<sup>e</sup> heling of them that be
  diseased with the kynges evill;" and has its illumination of Mary
  kneeling and placing her hands upon the neck of the diseased person, who
  is presented to her by the clerk; while the chaplain, in alb and stole,
  kneels on the other side. The MS. was exhibited at a meeting of the
  Archæological Institute on 6th June, 1851. Hearne, in one of his
  manuscript diaries in the Bodleian, lv. 190., mentions having seen
  certain prayers to be used by Queen Mary at the blessing of cramp rings.
  May not this be the identical MS. alluded to?</p>

  <p>But, to come to W. C. T.'s immediate question, "When did the use of
  these blest rings by our sovereigns cease?" The use never ceased till the
  change of religion. In addition to the evidence already given of the
  custom in the fifteenth century, may be added several testimonies of its
  continuance all through the sixteenth century. Lord Berners, when
  ambassador to the Emperor Charles V., writing "to my Lord Cardinal's
  grace" from Saragossa, June 31, 1518, says, "If your grace remember me
  with some crampe ryngs, ye shall doo a thing muche looked for; and I
  trust to bestowe thaym well with goddes grace." (<i>Harl. MS.</i> 295. f.
  119. See also Polydore Virgil, <i>Hist.</i> i. 8.; and Harpsfield.)
  Andrew Boorde, in his <i>Introduction to Knowledge</i>, mentions the
  blessing of these rings: "The kynges of England doth halow every yere
  crampe rynges, y<sup>e</sup> which rynges worne on one's finger doth
  helpe them whych hath the crampe:" and again, in his <i>Breviary of
  Health</i>, 1557, f. 166., mentions as a remedy against the cramp, "The
  kynge's majestie hath a great helpe in this matter, in halowing crampe
  ringes, and so given without money or petition."</p>

  <p>A curious remnant or corruption of the use of cramp rings is given by
  Mr. G. Rokewode, who says that in Suffolk "the use of cramp rings, as a
  preservative against fits, is not entirely abandoned. Instances occur
  where nine young men of a parish each subscribe a crooked sixpence, to be
  moulded into a ring, for a young woman afflicted with this malady."

<h3>TURNER'S VIEW OF LAMBETH PALACE.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vii., p. 15.)</p>

  <p>L. E. X. inquires respecting the first work exhibited by the late J.
  M. W. Turner, R.A. The statement of the newspaper referred to was
  correct. The first work exhibited by Turner was a water-colour drawing of
  Lambeth Palace, and afterwards presented by him to a gentleman of this
  city, long since deceased. It is now in the possession of that
  gentleman's daughter, an elderly lady, who attaches no little importance
  to it. The fact is, that Mr. Turner, when young, was a frequent visitor
  at her father's house, and on such terms that her father lent Mr. Turner
  a horse to go on a sketching tour through South Wales. This lady has also
  three or four other drawings made at that time by Turner,&mdash;one a
  view of Stoke Bishop, near Bristol, then the seat of Sir Henry
  Lippincott, Bart., which he made as a companion to the Lambeth Palace;
  another is a small portrait of Turner by himself, of course when a youth.
  As the early indications of so great an artist, these drawings are very
  curious and interesting; but no person that knows anything of the state
  of water-colour painting at that period, and previous to the era when
  Turner, Girtin, and others began to shine out in that new and glorious
  style, that has since brought water-colour works to their present style
  of splendour, excellence, and value, will expect anything approaching the
  perfection of latter days.</p>

  <p class="address">28. Trinity Street, Bristol.</p>

  <p>Whether or not the work deemed by L. E. X. to be the first exhibited
  by Turner may have been in water-colours, or be still in existence, I
  leave to other replicants, availing myself of the occasion to ask him or
  you, whether in 1787 two works of W. Turner, at Mr. G. Turner's,
  Walthamstow, "No. 471. Dover Castle," "No. 601. Wanstead House," were
  not, in fact, his first tilt in that arena of which he was the champion
  at the hour of his <!-- Page 90 --><span class="pagenum" title="091.png"
  ><a name="page90"></a>{90}</span>death? Whether in the two following
  years he appeared at all in the ring; and, if not, why not? although in
  the succeeding 1790 he again threw down the glaive in the "No. 644. The
  Archbishop's Palace, Lambeth," being then set down as "<i>T.</i> W.
  Turner;" reappearing in 1791 as "W. Turner, of Maiden Lane, Covent
  Garden," with "No. 494. King John's Palace, Eltham;" "No. 560. Sweakley,
  near Uxbridge." In the horizon of art (strange to say, and yet to be
  explained!) this luminary glows no more till 1808, when he had "on the
  line" (?) several views of Fonthill, as well as the "Tenth Plague of
  Egypt," purchased of course by the proprietor of that princely mansion,
  as it is found mentioned in Warner's <i>Walks near Bath</i> to be that
  same year adorning the walls of one of the saloons.</p>

<h3>GOLDSMITHS' YEAR-MARKS.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vi., p. 604.)</p>

  <p>In answer to <span class="sc">Mr. Livett's</span> Query, as to the
  marks or letters employed by the Goldsmiths' Company to denote the year
  in which the plate was "hall-marked," I subjoin a list of such as I am
  acquainted with, and which might with a little trouble be traced to an
  earlier period: I have also added a few notes relating to the subject
  generally, which may interest many of your readers.</p>

  <p>In the year 1596, the Roman capital A was used; in 1597, B; and so on
  alphabetically for twenty years, which would bring us to the letter U,
  denoting the year 1615: the alphabet finishing every twenty years with
  the letter U or V. The next year, 1616, commences with the Old English
  letter <img src="images/oldea.png" class="middle" style="height:2ex;" alt="Old English A" title="Old English A"
  />, and is continued for another twenty years in the Old English
  capitals. In 1636 is introduced another alphabet, called Court
  alphabet.</p>

  <p>The letter for the present year, 1853, being <img

  />.</p>

  <p>In this list it will appear difficult, at first sight, in looking at a
  piece of plate to ascertain its age, to determine whether it was
  manufactured between the years 1636 and 1655, or between 1696 and 1715,
  the Court hand being used in both these cycles: but (as will presently be
  mentioned) instead of the lion passant and leopard's head in the former,
  we shall find the lion's head erased, and Britannia, denoting the
  alteration of the standard during the latter period.</p>

  <p>The standard of gold, when first introduced into the coinage, was of
  24 carats fine; that is, pure gold. Subsequently, it was 23½ and half
  alloy; this, after an occasional debasement by Henry VIII., was fixed at
  22 carats fine and 2 carats alloy by Charles I.; and still continues so,
  being <!-- Page 91 --><span class="pagenum" title="092.png"><a
  name="page91"></a>{91}</span>called the old standard. In 1798 an act was
  passed allowing gold articles to be made of a lower or worse standard,
  viz., of 18 carats of fine gold out of 24; such articles were to be
  stamped with a crown and the figures 18, instead of the lion passant.</p>

  <p>The standard of silver has always (with the exception of about twenty
  years) been 11 oz. 2 dwts., and 18 dwts. alloy, in the pound: this was
  termed <i>sterling</i>, but very much debased from the latter end of
  Henry VIII. to the beginning of Elizabeth's reign. In the reign of
  William III., 1697, an act was passed to alter the standard of silver to
  <span class="correction" title="Original wrongly reads '10 oz. 10 dwts.' Cf. below under 'The Standard Mark.'"
  >11 oz. 10 dwts.</span>, and 10 dwts. alloy: and instead of the usual
  marks of the lion and leopard's head, the stamps of this better quality
  of silver were the figure of a lion's head erased, and the figure of
  Britannia: and the variable letter denoting the date as before. This act
  continued in operation for twenty-two years, being repealed in 1719, when
  the standard was again restored.</p>

  <p>A duty of sixpence per ounce was imposed upon plate in 1719, which was
  taken off again in 1757; in lieu of which, a licence or duty of forty
  shillings was paid by every vendor of gold or silver. In 1784, a duty of
  sixpence per ounce was again imposed, and the licence still continued:
  which in 1797 was increased to one shilling, and in 1815 to
  eighteenpence&mdash;at which it still remains. The payment of this duty
  is indicated by the stamp of the sovereign's head.</p>

  <p>All gold plate, with the exception of watch-cases, pays a duty of
  seventeen shillings per ounce; and silver plate one shilling and
  sixpence; watch-cases, chains, and a few other articles being
  exempted.</p>

  <p>The letters used as dates in the foregoing list (it must be
  remembered) are only those of the Goldsmiths' Hall in London, as denoted
  by the leopard's head crowned. Other Halls, at York, Newcastle, Lincoln,
  Norwich, Bristol, Salisbury, and Coventry, had also marks of their own to
  show the year; and have stamped gold and silver since the year 1423,
  perhaps earlier. Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Dublin have had the same
  privilege from a very early period: and, more recently, Chester,
  Birmingham, and Sheffield. Thus it will be seen that four marks or
  punches are used on gold and silver plate, independent of the makers'
  initials or symbol, viz.:</p>

  <p><i>The Standard Mark.</i>&mdash;For gold of the old standard of 22

<h3>EDITIONS OF THE PRAYER-BOOK PRIOR TO 1662.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vi., pp. 435. 564.; Vol. vii., p. 18.)</p>

  <p>Since the publication of the professedly imperfect list of various
  editions of the Prayer-Book, at page 564. of your last volume, which list
  was compiled chiefly from liturgical works in my own possession, I have
  had occasion to consult the <i>Catalogue</i> of the British Museum, from
  which I have gleaned materials for a more full and correct enumeration.
  All the editions in the following list are in the library of the British
  Museum; and in order to increase its value and utility, I have appended
  to each article the press-mark by which it is now designated. In some of
  these press-marks a numeral is subscript, thus:</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="ac bb">C. 25. h. 7.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ac">1</td></tr>

  <p>In order to save space I have represented this in the following list

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC NOTES AND QUERIES.</h3>

  <p><i>Originator of the Collodion Process.</i>&mdash;All those who take
  any interest in photography must agree with your correspondent G. C. that
  M. Le Gray is a talented man, and has done much for photography. G. C.
  has given a very good translation of M. Le Gray's <i>last published
  work</i>, p. 89., which work I have: but I must take leave to observe,
  that it is no contradiction whatever to my statement. The translations to
  which M. Le Gray alludes, of 1850, appeared in Willat's publication, from
  which I gave him the credit of having first suggested the use of
  collodion in photography. The subject is there dismissed in three or four
  lines.</p>

  <p>M. Le Gray gave no directions whatever for its application to glass in
  his work published in July 1851, wherein he alludes to it only as an
  "encallage" for paper, classing it with amidou, the resins, &amp;c.,
  which he recommends in a similar manner.</p>

  <p>I had, four months previous to this, published the process in detail
  in the <i>Chemist</i>. I never asserted that he had not tried experiments
  with collodion in 1849; but he did not give the public the advantage of
  following him: and I again repeat that the first time M. Le Gray
  published the collodion process was in September, 1852,&mdash;a year and
  a half after my publication, and when it had become much used.</p>

  <p>It is obvious that if M. Le Gray had been in possession of any
  detailed process with collodion on glass in 1850, he would not have
  omitted to publish it in his work dated July, 1851.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">F. Scott Archer.</span></p>

  <p class="address">105. Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury.</p>

  <p>G. C., claiming for Le Gray the merit of the first use of collodion
  upon glass, states that a pamphlet upon the subject was published in
  1850, and which was <i>translated into English at the same time</i>. Will
  he oblige me by stating who published this pamphlet, or where it may be
  obtained? I have heard this statement before, and have used every
  endeavour to obtain a sight of the publication, but without success. Were
  the facts as stated by your correspondent, it would deprive <span
  class="sc">Mr. Archer</span> undoubtedly of the merit which he claims;
  but from all I have been able to learn, Le Gray mentioned collodion as a
  mere agent for obtaining a smooth surface to paper, or other substance,
  having no idea of making it the sole sensitive substance to be employed.
  I have been informed that in Vienna, early in 1850, collodion was tried
  upon glass by being first immersed in a bath of iodide of potassium; and
  it was afterwards placed in a second bath of nitrate of silver. These
  experiments had <i>very limited</i> success, and were never published,
  and certainly were unknown to <span class="sc">Mr. Archer</span>.</p>

  <p class="author">H. W. D.</p>

  <p><i>Mr. Weld Taylor's Process.</i>&mdash;In your 167th Number (Vol.
  vii., p. 48.) is a communication from <span class="sc">Weld Taylor</span>
  on photographic manipulation, which, in its present form, is perfectly
  unintelligible. At p. 48. he says: "Twenty grains of nitrate of silver in
  half an ounce of water is to have half an ounce of solution of iodide of
  potassium of fifty grains to the ounce added." Now this is unnecessarily
  mystifying. Why not say: "Take equal quantities of a forty-grain solution
  of nitrate of silver, and of a fifty-grain solution of iodide of
  potassium;" though, in fact, an <i>equal</i> strength would do as well,
  and be quite as, if not more, economical.</p>

  <p>In the next place, he directs that cyanide of potassium should be
  added <i>drop by drop</i>, &amp;c. It <!-- Page 93 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="094.png"><a name="page93"></a>{93}</span>is to be
  presumed that he means a <i>solution</i> of this salt, which is a solid
  substance as usually sold.</p>

  <p>What follows is so exceedingly droll, that I can do nothing more than
  <i>guess</i> at the meaning. How one <i>solution</i> is to be floated on
  another, and then, <i>after</i> a bath of nitrate of silver, is to be
  <i>ready for the camera</i>, surpasses my comprehension.</p>

  <p>Also, further on, he alludes to <i>iodizing</i> with the
  <i>ammonio-nitrate</i> (I presume of silver). What does he mean?</p>

  <p><i>Simplification of the Wax-paper Process.</i>&mdash;At a late
  meeting of the Chemical Discussion Society, Mr. J. How read the following
  paper on this subject:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The easiest way of waxing the paper is to take an iron (those termed
  'box-irons' are the cleanest and best for the purpose) moderately hot, in
  the one hand, and to pass it over the paper from side to side, following
  closely after it with a piece of white wax, held in the other hand, until
  the whole surface has been covered. By thus heating the paper, it readily
  imbibes the wax, and becomes rapidly saturated with it. The first sheet
  being finished, I place two more sheets of plain paper upon it, and
  repeat the operation upon the top one (the intermediate piece serving to
  absorb any excess of wax that may remain), and so on, sheet after sheet,
  until the number required is waxed.</p>

  <p>"The sheets, which now form a compact mass, are separated by passing
  the iron, moderately heated, over them; then placed between folds of
  bibulous paper, and submitted to a further application of heat by the
  means just described, so as to remove all the superfluous wax from the
  surface, and render them perfectly transparent&mdash;most essential
  points to be attended to in order to obtain fine negative proofs.</p>

  <p>"I will now endeavour to describe the method of preparing the iodizing
  solution.</p>

  <p>"Instead of being at the trouble of boiling rice, preparing isinglass,
  adding sugar of milk and the whites of eggs, &amp;c., I simply take some
  milk quite fresh, say that milked the same day, and add to it, drop by
  drop, glacial acetic acid, in about the proportion of one, or one and a
  half drachm, fluid measure, to the quart, which will separate the
  caseine, keeping the mixture well stirred with a glass rod all the time;
  I then boil it in a porcelain vessel to throw down the remaining caseine
  not previously coagulated, and also to drive off as much as possible of
  the superfluous acid it may contain. Of course any other acid would
  precipitate the caseine; still I give the preference to the acetic from
  the fact that it does not affect the after-process of rendering the paper
  sensitive, that acid entering into the composition of the sensitive
  solution.</p>

  <p>"After boiling for five or ten minutes, the liquid should be allowed
  to cool, and then be strained through a hair sieve or a piece of muslin,
  to collect the caseine: when quite cold, the chemicals are to be
  added.</p>

  <p>"The proportions I have found to yield the best results are those
  recommended by Vicomte Veguz, which I have somewhat modified, both as
  regard quantities and the number of chemicals employed. They are as
  follow:</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="ar pr025"> 385</td>
<td class="ac pr025 pl025"> grains</td>
<td class="pl025"> of iodide of potassium.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar pr025"> 60</td>
<td class="ac pr025 pl025"> "</td>
<td class="pl025"> of bromide.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar pr025"> 30</td>
<td class="ac pr025 pl025"> "</td>
<td class="pl025"> of cyanide.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar pr025"> 20</td>
<td class="ac pr025 pl025"> "</td>
<td class="pl025"> of fluoride.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar pr025"> 10</td>
<td class="ac pr025 pl025"> "</td>
<td class="pl025"> of chloride of sodium in crystals.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar pr025"> 1½</td>
<td class="ac pr025 pl025"> "</td>
<td class="pl025"> of resublimed iodine.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>"The above are dissolved in thirty-five ounces of the strained liquid,
  and, after filtration through white bibulous paper, the resulting fluid
  should be perfectly clear and of a bright lemon colour.</p>

  <p>"The iodized solution is now ready for use, and may be preserved, in
  well-stopped bottles, for any length of time.</p>

  <p>"The waxed paper is laid in the solution, in a flat porcelain or gutta
  percha tray, in the manner described by M. Le Gray and others, and
  allowed to remain there for from half an hour to an hour, according to
  the thickness of the paper. It is then taken out and hung up to dry, when
  it should be of a light brown colour. All these operations may be carried
  on in a light room, taking care only that, during the latter part of the
  process, <!-- Page 94 --><span class="pagenum" title="095.png"><a
  name="page94"></a>{94}</span>the paper be not exposed to the direct rays
  of the sun.</p>

  <p>"The 'iodized paper,' which will keep for almost any length of time,
  should be placed in a portfolio, great care being taken to lay it
  perfectly flat, otherwise the wax is liable to crack, and thus spoil the
  beauty of the negative. The papers manufactured by Canson Frères and
  Lacroix are far preferable, for this process, to any of the English
  kinds, being much thinner and of a very even texture.</p>

  <p>"To render the paper sensitive, use the following solution:</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td> 150 grains nitrate of silver crystals.</td></tr>
<tr><td> 3 fluid drachms glacial acetic acid, crystallizable.</td></tr>
<tr><td> 5 ounces distilled water.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>"This solution is applied in the way described by Le Gray, the marked
  side of the paper being towards the exciting fluid. The paper is washed
  in distilled water and dried, as nearly as possible, between folds of
  bibulous paper. It should be kept, till required for the camera, in a
  portfolio, between sheets of stout blotting-paper, carefully protected
  from the slightest ray of light, and from the action of atmospheric air.
  If prepared with any degree of nicety, it will remain sensitive for two
  or three weeks: indeed I have seen some very beautiful results on paper
  which had been kept for a period of six weeks. At this time of year, an
  exposure in the camera of from ten to twenty minutes is requisite.</p>

  <p>"The picture may be developed with gallic acid, immediately after its
  removal from the camera; or, if more convenient, that part of the process
  may be delayed for several days. Whilst at this section of my paper, I
  may, perhaps, be allowed to describe a method of preparing the solution
  of gallic acid, whereby it may be kept, in a good state of preservation,
  for several months. I have kept it myself for four months, and have found
  it, after the lapse of that period, infinitely superior to the newly-made
  solution. This process has, I am informed, been alluded to in
  photographic circles; but not having seen it in print, and presuming the
  fact to be one of great practical importance, I trust I shall be excused
  for introducing it here, should it not possess that degree of novelty I
  attribute to it.</p>

  <p>"What is generally termed a saturated solution of gallic acid is, I am
  led to believe, nothing of the kind. In all the works on photography, the
  directions given run generally as follow:&mdash;'Put an excess of gallic
  acid into distilled water, shake the mixture for about five minutes,
  allow it to deposit, and then pour off the supernatant fluid, which is
  found to be a saturated solution of the acid.'</p>

  <p>"Now I have found by constant experiment, that by keeping an excess of
  acid in water for several days, the strength of the solution is greatly
  increased, and its action as a developing agent materially improved. The
  method I have adopted is to put half an ounce of crystallized gallic acid
  into a stoppered quart bottle, and then so to fill it up with water as
  that, when the stopper is inserted, a little of the water is displaced,
  and, consequently, every particle of air excluded.</p>

  <p>"The solution thus prepared will keep for several months. When a
  portion of it is required, the bottle should be refilled with fresh
  distilled water, the same care being taken to exclude every portion of
  atmospheric air,&mdash;to the presence of which I am led to believe, is
  due the decomposition of the ordinary solution of gallic acid.</p>

  <p>"It will be needless to detain you further in explaining the
  after-processes, &amp;c. to be found in any of the recent works on the
  Waxed-paper Process, the translation of the last edition of Le Gray being
  the one to which I give the preference."</p>

<h3>THE BURIAL SERVICE SAID BY HEART.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vii., p. 13.)</p>

  <p>Southey has confounded two stories in conjecturing that the anecdote
  mentioned by Bp. Sprat related to Bull. It was the <i>baptismal</i> and
  not the <i>funeral</i> service that Bull repeated from memory.</p>

  <p>I quote from his <i>Life</i> by Robert Nelson:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A particular instance of this happened to him while he was minister
  of St. George's (near Bristol); which, because it showeth how valuable
  the Liturgy is in itself, and what unreasonable prejudices are sometimes
  taken up against it, the reader will not, I believe, think it unworthy to

  <p>"He was sent for to baptize the child of a Dissenter in his parish;
  upon which occasion, he made use of the office of Baptism as prescribed
  by the Church of England, which he had got entirely by heart. And he went
  through it with so much readiness and freedom and yet with so much
  gravity and devotion, and gave that life and spirit to all that he
  delivered, that the whole audience was extremely affected with his
  performance; and, notwithstanding that he used the sign of the cross, yet
  they were so ignorant of the offices of the Church, that they did not
  thereby discover that it was the Common Prayer. But after that he had
  concluded that holy action, the father of the child returned him a great
  many thanks; intimating at the same time with how much greater
  edification they prayed who entirely depended upon the Spirit of God for
  his assistance in their <i>extempore</i> effusions, than those did who
  tied themselves up to premeditated forms; and that, if he had not made
  the sign of the cross, that badge of Popery, as he called it, nobody
  could have formed the least objection against his excellent Prayers. Upon
  which, Mr. Bull, hoping to recover him from his ill-grounded prejudices,
  showed him the office of Baptism in the Liturgy, wherein was contained
  every prayer that was offered up to God on that occasion; which, with
  farther arguments that he then urged, so effectually <!-- Page 95
  --><span class="pagenum" title="096.png"><a
  name="page95"></a>{95}</span>wrought upon the good man and his whole
  family, that they always after that time frequented the parish-church;
  and never more absented themselves from Mr. Bull's communion."&mdash;Pp.
  39&mdash;41., Lond. 1714, 8vo.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Some few dates will prove that Bull could not have been the person
  alluded to. Bp. Sprat's <i>Discourse to the Clergy of his Diocese</i> was
  delivered in the Year 1695. And he speaks of the minister of the London
  parish as one who "was afterwards an eminent Bishop of our Church." We
  must therefore suppose him to have been <i>dead</i> at the time of Bp.
  Sprat's visitation. Now, in the first place (as J. K. remarks), "Bull
  never held a London cure." And, in the second place, he was not
  consecrated Bishop until the 29th of April, 1705 (ten years after Bp.
  Sprat's visitation), and did not die until Feb. 1709-10. (<i>Life</i>,
  pp. 410&mdash;474.)</p>

  <p>Southey's conjecture is therefore fatally wrong. And now as regards
  Bp. Hacket. The omission of the anecdote from the <i>Life</i> prefixed to
  his <i>Sermons</i> must, I think, do away with his claims also, though he
  was restored to his parish of St. Andrew's, Holborn, and was not
  consecrated Bishop of Lichfield until December, 1661. Unfortunately, I
  have not always followed Captain Cuttle's advice, or I should now be able
  to contribute some more decisive information. I have my own suspicions on
  the matter, but am afraid to guess in print.</p>

  <p><i>Jennings Family</i> (Vol. vi., p. 362.).&mdash;This family is
  supposed to have continued from some time in Cornwall, after the
  Visitation of 1620; but the name is not now found there in any great
  respectability. William Jennings of Saltash was sheriff of Cornwall,
  1678; but his arms differ from those of the Visitation: argent, a chevron
  gules between three mariners, plumets sable.</p>

  <p>Francis Jennnings, who recorded the pedigree of 1620, married the
  daughter of <i>Spoure</i> of Trebartha; and in a MS. book of that family,
  compiled about the latter part of the seventeenth century, the same arms,
  strange to say, are stated to be his, and not the lion rampant of the
  Jennings of Shropshire. This seems to support the hypothesis that William
  Jennings, the sheriff, was the same family. The <i>Spoure</i> MSS. also
  mention "Ursula, sister of Sir William Walrond of Bradfield, Devon, who
  married first, William Jennings of <i>Plymouth</i> (query, the sheriff?),
  and afterwards the Rev. William Croker, Rector of Wolfrey
  (Wolfardisworthy?) Devon."</p>

  <p><i>Statue of St Peter at Rome</i> (Vol. vi., p. 604.).&mdash;This
  well-known bronze statue is falsely stated to be a Jupiter converted. It
  is very far from being true, though popularly it passes as truth, that
  the statue in question is the ancient statue of Jupiter Capitolinus, with
  certain alterations.</p>

  <p>Another commonly-received opinion regarding this statue is, that it
  was cast for a St. Peter, <i>but of the metal of the statue of Jupiter
  Capitolinus</i>. But this can scarcely be true, for Martial informs us
  that in his own time the statue of the Capitoline Jupiter was not of
  bronze but of <i>gold</i>.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Undoubtedly the statue was cast for a St. Peter. It was cast in the
  time of St. Leo the Great (440-461), and belonged to the ancient church
  of St. Peter's. St. Peter has the nimbus on his head; the first two
  fingers of the right hand are raised in the act of benediction; the left
  hand holds the keys, and the right foot projects from the pedestal. The
  statue is seated on a pontifical chair of white marble.</p>

  <p><i>Old Silver Ornament</i> (Vol. vi., p. 602.).&mdash;This ornament is

  regiment. It represents precisely the badge worn by the baronets of Nova
  Scotia, the device upon which was the saltier of St. Andrew, with the
  royal arms of Scotland on an escutcheon in the centre; the whole
  surrounded by the motto, and ensigned with the royal crown. The insignia

  <p><i>Did the Carians use Heraldic Devices?</i> (Vol. vi., p.

  <span class="sc">Mr. Booker</span>.</p>

  <p>Herodotus ascribes the first use, or, as he expresses it, the
  invention of signs on shields, which we call arms, and of the supporter
  or handle of the shield, which till then had been suspended by straps
  from the neck, as well as of the tuft of feathers or horse-hair on the
  helmet, to the Carians; in which Strabo agrees with him, and, as far as
  regards the supporters and crest, Ælian also:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Herodot schrieb den ersten Gebrauch, oder wie er sich ausdrückt, die
  Erfindung der Zeichen auf Schilden, die wir Wappen nennen, wie auch der
  Halter oder Handhaben an den Schilden, die bis dahin nur an Riemen um den
  Nacken getragen wurden, und die Büsche von Federn oder Rosshaaren auf den
  Helmen, den Cariern zu, worin ihm Strabo (<i>Geogr.</i> 14. <span
  class="sm">I.</span> § 27.), und was die Handhaben und Helmbüsche
  betrifft, auch Ælian (<i>Hist. Animal.</i> 12. 30.),
  beistimmen."&mdash;Bernd's <i>Wappenwissen der Griechen und Römer</i>, p.
  4. Bonn, 1841.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>On Thucydides i. 8., where mention is made of Carians disinterred by
  the Athenians in the island of Delos, the scholiast, evidently referring
  to the passage cited by <span class="sc">Mr. Booker</span>, says:</p>

  <p>From Plutarch's <i>Artaxerxes</i> (10.) may be inferred, that the

  <p><i>Children crying at Baptism</i> (Vol. vi., p. 601.).&mdash;I am

  name="page97"></a>{97}</span>from the custom of <i>exorcism</i>, which
  was retained in the Anglican Church in the First Prayer-Book of King
  Edward VI., and is still commonly observed in the baptismal services of
  the Church of Rome. When the devil was going out of the possessed person,
  he was supposed to do so with reluctance: "The spirit cried, and rent him
  sore, and came out of him: and he was as one dead; insomuch that many
  said, He is dead." (St. Mark, ix. 26.) The tears and struggles of the
  infant would therefore be a convincing proof that the Evil One had
  departed. In Ireland (as every clergyman knows) nurses will decide the
  matter by pinching the baby, rather than allow him to remain silent and
  unlachrymose.</p>

  <i>Navorscher</i>), I send you this further supplemental notice.</p>

  <p>I described a table standing under the window, on the left-hand side
  of the room, containing on the end nearest to the spectator, not two
  pewter flagons, as I at first thought, but one glass and one pewter
  flagon. On the end of this table, which is presented to the spectator, is
  an inscription, which, as I have said, had hitherto escaped my notice,
  having been partially concealed by the frame&mdash;a modern one, not
  originally intended for this picture, and partly obscured by dirt which
  had accumulated in the corner. I can now make out very distinctly the
  following words, with the date, which fixes beyond a question the age of
  the picture:</p>

  <p>I may also mention, that the floor of the chamber represented in the
  picture is formed of large red and blue square tiles; and that the folio
  book standing on end, with another lying horizontally on the top of it,
  which I said in my former description to be standing on the end of the
  table, under the window, is, I now see, standing not on the table, but on
  the floor, next to the chair of the grave and studious figure who sits in
  the left-hand corner of the room.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>One of the most beautifully got up cheap publications which we have
  seen for a long time, is the new edition of Byron's <i>Poems</i>, just
  issued by Mr. Murray. It consists of eight half-crown volumes, which may
  be separately purchased, viz. Childe Harold, one volume; Tales and Poems,
  one volume; and the Dramas, Miscellanies, and Don Juan, &amp;c.,
  severally in two volumes. Mr. Murray has also made another important
  contribution to the cheap literature of the day in the republication, in
  a cheap and compendious form, of the various Journals of Sir Charles
  Fellows, during those visits to the East to which we owe the acquisition
  of the Xanthian Marbles. The present edition of his <i>Travels and
  Researches in Asia Minor, and more particularly in the Province of
  Lycia</i>, as it embraces the substance of all Sir Charles's various
  journals and pamphlets, and only omits the Greek and Lycian inscriptions,
  and lists of plants and coins, and such plates as were not capable of
  being introduced into the present volume, will, we have no doubt, be
  acceptable to a very numerous class of readers, and takes its place among
  the most interesting of the various popular narratives of Eastern
  travel.</p>

  <p>Most of our readers will probably remember the memorable remark of
  Lord Chancellor King, that "if the ancient discipline of the Church were
  lost, it might be found in all its purity in the Isle of Man." Yet
  notwithstanding this high eulogium on the character of the saintly Bishop
  Wilson, it is painful to find that his celebrated work, <i>Sacra
  Privata</i>, has hitherto been most unjustifiably treated and mutilated,
  as was noticed in our last volume, p. 414. But here we have before us, in
  a beautifully printed edition of this valuable work, the good bishop
  <i>himself</i>, what he thought, and <!-- Page 98 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="099.png"><a name="page98"></a>{98}</span>what he
  wrote, in his <i>Private Meditations, Devotions, and Prayers</i>, now for
  the first time printed from his original manuscripts preserved in the
  library of Sion College, London. Much praise is due to the editor for
  bringing this manuscript before the public, as well as for the careful
  superintendence of the press; and we sincerely hope he will continue his
  labours of research in Sion College as well as in other libraries.</p>

  <p>There are doubtless many of our readers who echo Ben Jonson's wish
  that Shakspeare had blotted many a line, referring of course to those
  characteristic of the age, not of the man, which cannot be read aloud. To
  all such, the announcement that Messrs. Longman have commenced the
  publication in monthly volumes of a new edition of Bowdler's <i>Family
  Shakspeare, in which nothing is added to the original text, but those
  words and expressions are omitted which cannot with propriety be read in
  a family</i>, will be welcome intelligence. The work is handsomely
  printed in Five-Shilling Volumes, of which the first three are already
  published.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Books Received.</span>&mdash;<i>Memoirs of James
  Logan, a distinguished Scholar and Christian Legislator, &amp;c.</i>, by
  Wilson Armistead. An interesting biography of a friend of William Penn,
  and one of the most learned of the early emigrants to the American
  Continent.&mdash;<i>Yule-Tide Stories, a Collection of Scandinavian and
  North German Popular Tales and Traditions.</i> The name of the editor,
  Mr. Benjamin Thorpe, is a sufficient guarantee for the value of this new
  volume of Bohn's <i>Antiquarian Library</i>. In his <i>Philological
  Library</i>, Mr. Bohn has published a new and enlarged edition of Mr.
  Dawson W. Turner's <i>Notes on Herodotus</i>: while in his <i>Classical

  enriched his <i>Scientific Library</i> by the publication of Dr.

  God, as manifested in the Adaption of External Nature to the Moral and
  Intellectual Constitution of Man</i>, with the author's last corrections,
  and a Biographical Preface by Dr. Cumming.</p>

  <p><i>Photographic Manipulation.</i> <i>The Wax-paper Process of Gustave

  and <i>Hennah's Directions for obtaining both Positive and Negative
  Pictures upon Glass by means of the Collodion Process, &amp;c.</i>,
  published by Delatouche &amp; Co., are two little pamphlets which will
  repay the photographer for perusal, but are deficient in that simplicity
  of process which is so much to be desired if Photography is to be made
  more popular.</p>
